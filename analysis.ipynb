    "This notebook compares the new and old NFT Worlds' staking formulas. There is 1.75 billion $WRLD reserved for staking rewards, to be distributed over a five year period. This defines a constant rate of rewards $R$. Each world owner will receive a fraction of these rewards based on the number of worlds they own as well as their rarity. **Short story: the previous formula did not guarantee that staking rewards would last for five years; the new formula does guarantee this, and the daily staking rewards are likely to be slightly higher.**\n",
